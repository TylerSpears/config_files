# This is a "template" for a ~/.bash_profile, without sharing anything private. Simply
# copying it does nothing.

# This file contains environment variables and configurations that are
# specific to this host only. If anything can be easily put into
# a shared configuration file, then it should be there. This is meant
# as a "last resort".

# Environment variable for setting the character that prefixes the terminal line.
# My personal preference is to use a greek character that corresponds to the first letter
# of the machine's hostname. This replaces the more commonly-used '$' in *nix.
# export PS1_CHAR=Îµ

# Environment variable for this machine's dotdrop profile. Only 'debian' is valid for now.
# export DOTDROP_PROFILE='debian'

# Sources ~/.bash_profile_public as an extension of ~/.bash_profile, but for commands
# that can be safely shared.
