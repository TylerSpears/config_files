# Files and Folders to ignore
# This file belongs in the root directory of the git repository.
# The file patterns indicate which files and directories to ignore when performing
# a `git add` command. Consequently, this files will not be saved remotely, but
# also will not have to be dealt with by others who pull from this repository. 

# In the case where the contents of a specific folder should be ignored, place
# another `.gitignore` file in that directory.
# For example, if you want all contents of the folder to be ignored (such as a /data dir)
# but want to keep the dir itself, you can place this text in a `.gitignore` file in that dir
# (remove the comment symbol where appropriate):
##################
# Ignore everything in this dir, don't want to track large binaries 
# *
# except this file
# !.gitignore

## Media files
# we don't want git to track large media files; point to external sources
# if necessary, or the code should generate the media itself.
# If large binaries **need** to be tracked, then look at *git LFS* (Large File Storage)
