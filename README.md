# Configuration Files

Repository for my commonly-used configuration files, including dotfiles, 
(non-sensitive) system files, configurations, and more.

## Special Thanks

These configurations were largely taken from or based on the work of others,
and I will do my best to give credit where credit is due. So, special thanks
